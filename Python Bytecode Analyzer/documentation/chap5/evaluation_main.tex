\chapter{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\par In the first section, the importance of Program Analysis was outlined, along with the lack of Program Analysis frameworks. This project aimed to create a framework that simplifies the engineering complexity of 
further analyses by creating an \acs{IR} and automating processes, such as fact generation and control flow analysis.
\par Developed using the Python programming language, \acs{PATH} is an accurate fact generating tool that produces an intuitive \acs{IR} and is also able to conduct Control Flow Analysis. The framework created operates with linear time complexity due to its iterative design.
Thus, providing users with an advantage compared to other polynomial-time frameworks, such as Andersen's Points-To analysis. \acs{PATH} also covers over 90\% of the CPython bytecodes, proving to be versatile.
\par Further work on the \acs{IR} is possible, such as implementing more instructions. The implementation of other types of analyses, such as Data Flow analysis would also be a non-trivial task to implement as the backbone (creation of the \acs{CFG}) is already implemented.
Implementing these features would make the framework more versatile, possibly contending with currently available Program Analysis Tools.
